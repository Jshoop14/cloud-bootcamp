# Week 5 & 6: AWS VPC Architecture and Exercises

During Week 5 and 6, we focused on designing and implementing a secure and highly available VPC architecture in AWS. This architecture includes public and private subnets, NAT gateways, and secure access for web and database tiers.

## VPC Architecture Design Exercise

In this exercise, we designed a secure VPC architecture with high availability across two Availability Zones (AZs), utilizing various AWS services such as EC2, NAT Gateways, Internet Gateways, and DynamoDB.
