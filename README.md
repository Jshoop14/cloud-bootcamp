# Cloud Bootcamp Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains my projects and weekly summaries from the 13-week cloud bootcamp. The goal of this project is to develop and showcase cloud solutions using AWS, Azure, and other cloud-based tools. The repository will be regularly updated to reflect my learning progress, new projects, and cloud infrastructure tasks.

## Features

- Weekly summaries covering cloud fundamentals, hands-on projects, and new tools learned.
- Example cloud infrastructure projects, such as setting up AWS S3 storage, EC2 instances, and Azure VM provisioning.
- Collaboration-ready projects for co-workers and cloud teams.
- Real-world use cases such as cloud automation, infrastructure-as-code, and security implementations.
