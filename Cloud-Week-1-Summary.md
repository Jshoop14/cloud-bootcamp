# Week 1: Introduction to Cloud Computing

In the first week of the bootcamp, we covered the basics of **cloud computing**, including its general definition and key benefits such as **scalability, cost efficiency, and flexibility**. We explored different **cloud deployment models** (public, private, and hybrid clouds) and the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**. 

Finally, we created our **AWS** and **Azure** accounts, which will serve as the foundation for future hands-on cloud projects.
